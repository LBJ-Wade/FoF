Velocity selection
------------------

R 12 D 4
Mass range: 14.6-15.6
Mass-redshift: Moderate-low scatter, increasing trend
Mag-R: R2 = 0.450, Vertical bars at every value at low richness (strange) with very slight increasing trend
Catalog matching: 241/532 - 45.3%; 130/209 - 62.2%; 100/155 - 64.5%
Richness matching: good mix near y=x with more catalog overestimation; good mix near y=x; sample is overestimated

R 25 D 4 (FAIL)
Mass range: 15.1-15.7
Mass-redshift: Moderate scatter with increasing trend
Mag-R: very slight increasing trend, R2 = 0.421, obvious vertical cutoff at 25

R 40 D 4 (FAIL)
Mass range: 15.1-15.7
Mass-redshift: Higher scatter and sparseness at low z than R25 with increasing trend.
Mag-R: R2 = 0.286, More obvious cutoff at 40

R 50 D 4 (FAIL)
Mass range: 15.1-15.7
Mass-redshift: Very sparse with increasing trend
Mag-R: R2 = 0.25, obvious cutoff at 50


Redshift Binning
----------------

z-factor = 0.02
R 25 D 4
Mass range: 15.7-16.5
Mass-redshift: Increasing trend with increasing scatter. Moderate overall scatter, more compared to z-factor=0.04.
Mag-R: R2 = 0.534, obvious cutoff at R=25, increasing trend

ultra_deep, cosmic_web, deep_field
Catalog matching: 64/140 - 45.7%; 33/59 - 55.9%; 50/77 - 64.9%
Richness matching: Good mix near y=x; good trend; sample is overestimated

R 40 D 4 (FAIL)
Mass range: 15.8-16.5
Mass-redshift: High scatter with increasing trend
Mag-R: R2 = 0.426, obvious cutoff at R=40, slight increasing trend

z-factor = 0.04 (FAIL)
R 40 D 4 
Mass range: 16.2-17.0
Mass-redshift: Increasing trend follow but a decrease after z=2.25. Low scatter compared to velocity selection
Mag-R: R2 = 0.567, no cutoffs at lower R
Catalog matching: 29/69 - 42.0%; 13/23 - 56.5%; 7/16 - 43.75%
Richness matching: sample more overestimated; sample is a little overestimated; sample is overestimated


comparing redshift 0.02 and 0.04:
    redshift 0.02 seems to have better richness match, while catalog matching is about the same. however, redshift 0.02 has large scatter for the richness-brightness relationship.
    redshift 0.04 has less scatter for brightness-richness dependence. both are for R40 D4. try R25 for 0.02?
    redshift 0.02 also has lower mass by almost 1 magnitude than 0.04
    redshift 0.02 richness-mag graph seems to show a lot of clusters are at richness 40, indicating possible hard cut

comparing R40 and R25 with D2 and D4:
