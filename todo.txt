CLUSTER FINDING AND MASS ESTIMATION
1. Remove galaxies from edges, corners and masked areas (DONE)
2. Correct for Malmquist bias - Cut data at peak (DONE)
3. Obtain cluster sample for 0.5 < z < 2.5 (DONE)
    3.1 Check through sample and filter them 
    3.2 Apply catalogue matching, richness accuracy test and cluster mass to compare between cluster sample and catalogues (DONE)
    3.3 Interloper removal (Add to DB but do not replace!) (DONE)
4. Obtain mass estimates (DONE)
    5.1 Perform mass correction (DONE but weird results)
    5.2. Compare projected mass and corrected virial mass (DONE)
5. Obtain parameters for all clusters and add to DB
    1. Cluster Mass before interloper removal 
    2. Cluster Mass after interloper removal
    3. Virial radius
    4. Cluster velocity dispersion
    5. Others?
6. Plotting


ANALYSIS - HALF QUANTITATIVE, HALF QUALITATIVE
7. Compare evolution of substructure in clusters [DYNAMICAL STATE]
    1. Identify substructure with substructure tests (Dressler & Shectman, 1988)
8. Compare evolution of density profile and compare to NFW profile [FORMATION TIME]
    1. Plot NFW profile
    2. Plot normalized median density profile (how?) wrt to radius 
9. Observe for correlation between mass change across redshift bins and expected virial relation [GLOBAL MASS FUNCTION]
    1. Bin sample into redshift bins
    2. Calculate median masses in each bin
    3. Plot mass change wrt to redshift bins
    4. Calculate KE and PE of entire cluster (how? Account for substructure, scatter?)
10. Test Press & Schechter (P&S) formalism for self-similar evolution (Qualitative?)
    1. Plot and analyze global cluster mass function (how?). 
    2. Can relate to cosmological parameters?
11. Examine differences of clusters with different N or R



SEMI IMPORTANT
1. Apply mass weighting to virial_mass_estimator
2. Compare sample masses with catalogue masses
3. Calculate uncertainties (astropy bootstrap method)
    1. Quantities to calculate uncertainty: cluster mass, velocity dispersion, virial radius


4. Look into standardizing units of little h (Croton, 2013)
    1. Astropy littleh equivalence




OPTIONAL
1. Do Voronoi tessellation?
2. Join with SDSS masses and compare

SELECTION CRITERIA FOR ABELL CATALOGUE
A cluster of galaxies listed in the Abell Catalogue. 
To appear in the catalogue, a cluster must satisfy selection criteria which include containing more than 50 galaxies and having a dense concentration (richness). 
The clusters are classified as regular (R) or irregular (I) in appearance, ranked in increasing richness from 1 to 5, and increasing distance from 1 to 6. 
The approximate frequency of Abell clusters is one per 2.4 Ã— 105 cubic megaparsecs.
