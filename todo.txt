KEY TASKS
1. Remove galaxies from edges, corners and masked areas (DONE?)
2. Correct for Malmquist bias - 1. Cut data (DONE)
3. Apply selection criteria from Abell Catalogue 
4. Obtain cluster sample (before and after interloper removal)
5. Obtain mass estimates (add mass, virial radius, velocity dispersion to database)
6. Compare projected mass and virial mass estimates (DONE)
7. Apply catalogue matching and richness accuracy test to compare between cluster sample and catalogues
8. Compare sample masses with catalogue masses (X-ray group catalogue)

SEMI IMPORTANT
1. Obtain max_velocity of galaxies on the same LOS as center
2. Apply mass weighting to virial_mass_estimator

SPEED TASKS
1. Speed up virial_mass_estimator
2. Speed up interloper_removal


SELECTION CRITERIA FOR ABELL CATALOGUE
A cluster of galaxies listed in the Abell Catalogue. 
To appear in the catalogue, a cluster must satisfy selection criteria which include containing more than 50 galaxies and having a dense concentration (richness). 
The clusters are classified as regular (R) or irregular (I) in appearance, ranked in increasing richness from 1 to 5, and increasing distance from 1 to 6. 
The approximate frequency of Abell clusters is one per 2.4 Ã— 105 cubic megaparsecs.
