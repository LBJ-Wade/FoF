1. complete interloper_removal (DONE)
2. find new bcg_df (DONE)
3. perform comparison with new bcg_df based on richness accuracy

4. calculate virial masses of bcg_df (DONE)
5. perform comparison of virial masses to existing catalogues (source which catalogues??)

6. look at bookmarked catalog matching to improve accuracy of cluster_finder_checker? IMPORTANT
7. can i speed up virial_mass_estimator even more?
8. speed up interloper_removal

9. figure out how to check max_velocity of galaxies on the same LOS as center
10. remove galaxies at corner, edges and masked areas
